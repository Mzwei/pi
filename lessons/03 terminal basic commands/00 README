In the following lessons each folder will have either have a README file
or just file named with the instructions. If there should be more information
available try to read the file's contents. Either "cat" or "less" the file; 
or open it with vim (or your editor of choice) to read it.

We expect you to write down for each lesson a few sentences in the 
documentation. We will gather all the documentations in the end, and
give you a quick review via email.

If you encounter a problem with a command you do not understand, 
here is what you have to do (http://xkcd.com/627/):
    1. try
    2. try again :)
    3. search the web
    4. try again :)
    5. ask the assistants
    6. write down how it works in your documentation

If you're not sure exactely what to do, JUST ASK!

In this lesson you should learn the basic commands for the terminal (bash).
Try to solve all the exercises in this folder, and don't forget to update your
documentation if you see something special. 
By starting with the "man" command you know how to get information about a
typical unix command. Another way to get that is running something like this:

>> YOUR_COMMAND --help

By adding "--help" you tell the command to print its own help. Usually this
will display a list with all the command's options. By using "man" you get
a more complete descriptions of the command and its options.
