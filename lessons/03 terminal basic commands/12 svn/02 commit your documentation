If you get an error saying that no $SVN_EDITOR was found you have to 
manually set this global variable. These variables are stored in a file in
your home directory:

>> cd ~

To store that variable you have to edit a file named ".bashrc":

>> vim .bashrc

If that file existed already it has a couple of lines specifying different
variables which are used by bash.
Now add the following line to the file, which sets the $SVN_EDITOR variable:

export SVN_EDITOR=vim

From now on svn will use vim to edit the commit messages.
