If you want to execute several commands in parallel you can do that by using
the single ampersand "&":

>> (sleep 1 && echo 1 ) & echo 2
[3] 27733
2
[2]   Done                    ( sleep 1 && echo 1 )
1

Lets have a look at this command in detail:

    sleep 1     just blocks for one second
    echo 1      outputs 1
    echo 2      outputs 2

The sleep with the first echo are executed in parallel with the second echo.

    -> start            -> start
    sleep 1             echo 2
    -> still sleeping   -> finished
    echo 1             
    -> finished
