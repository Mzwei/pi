If you want to store an output of a command in a file you can use the simple
redirect ">":

>> grep 2008 grep.txt > out.txt

The greater than sign ">" works somewhat similar to piping "|". It just wrks
only with files as output.

There exists another operator, the double greater than ">>" appends to the
given output file:

>> echo 1 >> out.txt
>> echo 2 >> out.txt
>> cat out.txt

The output file "out.txt" will now contain two lines:

>> wc -l out.txt
    2 out.txt

Whereas, if I would have used only the single greater than ">" the file would
be overwritten each time and not appended:

>> echo 1 > out.txt
>> echo 2 > out.txt
>> cat out.txt
2

Another trick to make a command run silently is to /dev/null:

>> cat grep.txt > /dev/null

/dev/null is a special file/device that discards all data given to it.




There exist other operators:

    ">"     redirect to a file
    ">>"    redirect to a file by appending
    "2>"    redirect the warnings to a file
