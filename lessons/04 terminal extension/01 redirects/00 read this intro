If you want to store an output of a command in a file you can use the simple
redirect ">":

>> grep 2008 grep.txt > out.txt

The greater than sign ">" works somewhat similar to piping "|". It just wrks
only with files as output.

There exists another operator, the double greater than ">>" appends to the
given output file:

>> echo "eins" >> out.txt
>> echo "zwei" >> out.txt
>> cat out.txt
eins
zwei

The output file "out.txt" will now contain two lines:

>> wc -l out.txt
    2 out.txt

Whereas, if I would have used only the single greater than ">" the file would
be overwritten each time and not appended:

>> echo "eins" > out.txt
>> echo "zwei" > out.txt
>> cat out.txt
zwei

Another trick to make a command run silently is to /dev/null:

>> cat grep.txt > /dev/null

/dev/null is a special file/device that discards all data given to it.
If you 'ls' in /dev you well see a lot of these special files, if you're a 
beginner we suggest to always read first about such a special device before
starting to write to or read from them.

There exist other operators:

    ">"     redirect to a file
    ">>"    redirect to a file by appending
    "2>"    redirect the warnings (stderr) to a file
    "&>"    redirect both, the standard output (stdout) and the warnings
