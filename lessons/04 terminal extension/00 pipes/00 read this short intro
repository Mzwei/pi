Pipes are used in Linux to send output from one programm to another. This can
be used in the Terminal as well. Say we have a huge file:

>> wget http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.txt
>> cat grep.txt

Now if I grep for "devil" there won't be too many matching lines in the output:

>> grep devil grep.txt

But what about "is"?

>> grep is grep.txt
....

Way too much stuff here!! So somehow we should be able to use "less" to scroll
through the text, as we did with a file already. In order to so that you have
to pass in the results from "grep" to "less" by using pipes:

>> grep is grep.txt | less

Now you can easily navigate through the results from grep.

By using pipes you can redirect the output from one command to another command:

>> command1 | command2 | command3 | ...
