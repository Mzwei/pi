There are two possible solution to create an own website.
The first one is from the Informatik Dienste (id.unibe.ch):
    
    http://www.id.unibe.ch/content/e5911/e6366/e6478/e6480

And is not really recommendable if you have an iamexwi/pool account. There is a
short info page at this strange page:
    
    http://www.iamexwi.unibe.ch/system/pool/

So you see: you've another free email address with your pool account ;). Now
this account can also be for hosting a website as well:
    
    http://www.iamexwi.unibe.ch/~USERNAME

This will most probably just show an error page for your account. To get this
problem fixed, create a directory named "public_html" in your home directory.
If you now open the previous URL in your browser (there is "links" for the 
command line) you can see an empty directory listed.

Now copy the "index.html" file into your public_html. If you now open
the URL again you'll see that magically another site pops up. So what happened?
Usually if you request an URL the webserver will just display a list of 
directories and files. But it first tries to server an index.html file if it
exists. So whenever you put an index.html file into a directory it will be
directly displayed if you open this directory with the browser.
