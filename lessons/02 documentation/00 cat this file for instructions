Ask the assistant for setting up the documentation for you.
Then checkout the documentation template written in Latex from:

http://bender.unibe.ch/svn/pi/students/YOUR_USER_NAME/

using the following commands ("cd", "pwd", "ls" and "svn").
Note that the lines starting with a hash # are comments.

>> # check where we are
>> pwd
>> # first change the current working directory
>> cd ../..
>> # then check again
>> pwd

>> # then we get the documentation from the server by using the "svn" command
>> # Where YOUR_USER_NAME@students.unibe.ch
>> svn checkout http://bender.unibe.ch/svn/pi/students/YOUR_USER_NAME/ documentation

>> # lets check if everything is here and list all the files in the 
>> # current working directory
>> ls

>> # now let's see whats in that documentation directory you just checked out
>> cd documentation
>> ls

>> # to edit the documentation open it with vim (in the terminal)
>> vim documentation.tex

>> # after saving create the pdf file using the following command
>> make

>> # or you can directly create AND view the pdf which is usually more convenient
>> make view
