INFO:

In the following lessons each folder will have a README file.
Either "cat" the file or open it with vim ( or your editor of choice) to
read it.

We expect you to write down for each lesson a few sentences in the 
documentation. We will gather all the documentations in the end, and
give you a quick review via email.

If you encounter a problem with a command you do not understand, 
here is what you have to do:
    1. try
    2. try again :)
    3. search the web
    4. try again :)
    5. ask the assistants
    6. write down how it works in your documentation

If you're not sure exactely what to do, JUST ASK!

LESSON 03:

In this lesson you should learn the basic commands for the terminal (bash).
First read the chapter in the documentation and have a quick look at the 
list of commands.
Try to solve all the exercises in this folder, and don't forget to update your
documentation. 
By starting with the "man" command you know how to get information about a
typical unix command. Another way to get that is to run something like this:

>> YOUR_COMMAND --help

By adding "--help" you tell the command to print its own help. Usually this 
is mostly about all the possible options of a command, which is not that
important for you at the moment. Each time we want you to use a certain option
we will explicitely tell you in the exercise.
