Ask the assistant for setting up the documentation for you.
Then checkout the documentation template written in Latex from:

http://bender.unibe.ch/svn/pi/students/YOUR_USER_NAME/

using the following commands ("cd", "pwd", "ls" and "svn").
Note that the lines starting with a hash # are comments.

>> # check where we are
>> pwd
>> # first change the current working directory
>> cd ../..
>> # then check again
>> pwd

>> # then we get the documentation from the server by using the "svn" command
>> # Where YOUR_USER_NAME@students.unibe.ch
>> svn checkout http://bender.unibe.ch/svn/pi/students/YOUR_USER_NAME/ documentation

>> # lets check if everything is here and list all the files in the 
>> # current working directory
>> ls

>> # now let's see whats in that documentation directory you just checked out
>> cd documentation
>> ls

>> # to edit the documentation open it with vim (in the terminal)
>> vim documentation.tex

>> # after saving create the pdf file using the following command
>> make

>> # or you can directly create AND view the pdf which is usually more convenient
>> make view

>> # after running make you will see a couple of files created
>> ls
>> # to remove them run the "make" command with "clean"
>> make clean
>> ls


Now read the docuemnt carfully and try to make the link between the source
file "documentation.tex" and the viewed pdf. The goal is to write down all
the notes for this course in latex.
