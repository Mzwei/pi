- Open "irb" in you terminal and use it for this lesson

- Create the string "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

- Put %w{ in front and } in the back. what do you have now?

- Assign it to a variable named "a" by using "a="

- Display the contents of "a" by using puts

- Display the size of "a"

- Sort "a"

- Figure out what "a.collect { |word| word.size }" does

- Now the same but use sort by instead of collect

- Check the documentation for "array#reject" and compare it with "array#collect"

- Use reject to create filter out all the elements which are longer than 3 characters

- Display all elements from "a" in uppercase using collect

- The same but in lowercase (the method is called downcase)

- Read the doc for "array#join"

- Use join with our "a"

- Display "a" in reversed order

- Cat this file and run that in irb

- Now use join instead of the pure "a" to display it nicely

- Display the first and the last element of "a"

- Read the array's "each" documentation

- Use puts in the each block to print each word of "a"

- Multiply "a"

- Add two a's together
