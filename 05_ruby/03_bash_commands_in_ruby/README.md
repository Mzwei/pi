- Run `ls` from within `irb` by typing the following (including the back ticks):
    
        `ls`

- Try that with other commands you know

- Now do a `to_a` on `ls` in `irb`. sounds familiar?

- Now transform all elements to uppercase using collect

- Store the result of ``ls`.to_a` in a variable named `list`

- Find out what `chomp` does with a string

- `chomp` all elements from `list` using `collect`

- Now `chomp` all elements and reverse the elements order in one line of ruby
  code

- Create a function which does that. The function should be called with
  `superSort(`ls`)`. If you don't remember how to create a function, here is
  how:

        def ${FUNCTION_NAME}(${ARGUMENTS})
            ...
        end

- Now create a function which takes the `'ls'` as a string and does the same
