- Run `vimtutor` in your terminal:
    
        vimtutor
  This program will teach you the basics of `vim` editing. Remember to use a
  second tab or terminal window to run `vimtutor` and keep this file open next
  to it.

- After finishing the `vimtutor` exercises create a file with your name in it.

- From now on you can use `vim` for viewing and editing files directly from
  within then terminal.

- Now go to the next lession, where you will learn about LaTeX. For that you
  have to go one directory up with `cd ..` and then change into the second
  lesson's folder named `02_documentation`. Remember to use tab-completion.
        
        cd ..
        cd 02_documentation
