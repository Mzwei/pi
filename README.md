Programming Introduction Course
===============================

Welcome to the introductory course for new computer scientist students at the
University of Berne. This course should give you an overview of how to use the
terminal, write simple bash scripts, create professional scientific documents
using latex and get the basics of programming in ruby.


Start
-----
All the course material are available on [github](http://github.com/dh83/pi).

1. Make sure you have access to a decent unix machine (OS X is partially ok)
   with a decent terminal ([iTerm](http://iterm.sourceforge.net/) under OS X
   is the only *decent* solution there). If you are under Windows either thing
   about installing a [Linux distribution](http://ubuntu.com) as a second
   system on your PC or use a [virtualization solution](http://virtualbox.org)
   to run a linux in parallel with your current system.

2. Load the course material from github using [git](http://git-scm.com/).
    git clone git://github.com/dh83/pi.git
   If this should fail you have to blame most probably the university's proxy.
   In order to make this work properly you have to manually set the proxy in
   the current shell:
    export http_proxy=http://proxy.unibe.ch:80/
