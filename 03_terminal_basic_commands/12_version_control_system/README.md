Versioning Systems the Programmer's Backup
==========================================

- Have you ever lost a file? 
- Did you accidentally overwrite an important section?
- Did you ever wonder what your document looked like in the early stages?

Most of these questions are answered by a resolute *YESS SIR!*. Now beeing a
computer scientist or programmer in general makes this task very easy. We do
so by using tools called *version management systems*. These programms help
you to keep track of changes to files and folders. 

[GIT](http://git-scm.org)
------------------------
A third generation versioning system with a complex and vast number of
commands. We strongly recommend learning this versioning system and use it
daily!

[SVN](http://subversion.org)
----------------------------
A second generation versioning system which is easier to use than git, but
much less stable. 
The exercises for this versioning system are optional, once you learned git,
you never want to change anymore.
