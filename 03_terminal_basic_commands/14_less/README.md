- Make sure you got the dictionary from the `grep` exercise

- Do `less ../13_grep/dict.txt` and use `q` to quit. Note that the navigation
  commands from `man` work here as well (`h` for a help page).

- Use `less` to search for `mouse` in your dictionary.

- Search again and use `n` and `N` to go to the next or previous search.

- Do the same from within `man less`
