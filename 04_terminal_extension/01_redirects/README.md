Redirects
=========

If you want to execute two commands in a row the general approach is:

>> echo 1; echo 2;

Which is equivalent to typing and executing two separate commands:

>> echo 1;
>> echo 2;

NB: "echo" just outputs the given string to the terminal


Exercises
---------
- Run the commands from the intro

- Store the output from the third pipe exercise to a file `out.txt`

- Now append the results from the third pipe exercises to this file

- `cat` your `out.txt` make it silent using redirection
